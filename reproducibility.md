1. Environment Setup
To reproduce the analysis, readers should have access to an R environment with the necessary libraries and packages installed. The key libraries used in this analysis are:

ggplot2: For data visualization and plotting.
dplyr: For data manipulation and transformation.
Ensure that these libraries are installed by running the following commands in R:
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")

2. Data Source
Readers can download the "Wellbeing and Lifestyle" dataset from Kaggle using the following link: Wellbeing and Lifestyle Dataset. Save the dataset file, "Wellbeing_and_lifestyle_data_Kaggle.csv," in the working directory or specify the correct file path in the code.

3. Data Loading and Preprocessing
To reproduce the data preprocessing steps, readers can use the provided code in the Data Loading and Preprocessing section. This code ensures that missing values are handled appropriately, and the dataset is cleaned before analysis.

4. Data Exploration and Analysis
The code for data exploration and analysis is presented in the Data Exploration and Analysis section. Readers can use the annotated code to calculate correlations between variables and perform data visualization.

5. Results and Interpretation
The results of the analysis, along with interpretations, are presented in the Results and Interpretation section. Readers can refer to this section for insights into the correlations between lifestyle factors and the Work/Life Balance Score.

6. Plots and Figures
The code for creating the visualizations, including the plots and figures, is available in the Results and Interpretation section. Readers can use this code to generate the same visualizations to understand the relationships between different variables.

7. Data Analysis Flow
The Code Organization section outlines the flow of the data analysis process and provides a structured approach to the case study. Readers can follow this flow to understand the step-by-step procedures used in the analysis.

By following these instructions and using the provided code, readers should be able to reproduce the data analysis presented in this case study and obtain the same results. Transparency in the analysis process enhances the credibility and reliability of the findings, allowing other researchers to validate and build upon the work.
