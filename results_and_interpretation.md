### Findings and Implications

During the analysis of the "Wellbeing_and_lifestyle_data_Kaggle" dataset, I explored various factors related to well-being and lifestyle to understand their influence on work/life balance. The findings revealed interesting correlations between different variables, shedding light on potential insights for achieving a balanced life.

#### Correlation Analysis:

Meditation Frequency vs. Work/Life Balance (Correlation: 0.416): I observed a moderate positive correlation between the frequency of weekly meditation and work/life balance scores. This suggests that engaging in regular meditation practices can contribute to a better work/life balance, enhancing satisfaction in both professional and personal domains.

Daily Shouting vs. Stress Level (Correlation: 0.303): The correlation analysis indicated a weak positive correlation between the number of times the participants shout in a day and their self-reported stress levels. Although the correlation isn't very strong, it implies that managing stress and emotions more effectively can positively impact overall well-being.

Daily Stress vs. Work/Life Balance (Correlation: -0.365): The analysis revealed a moderate negative correlation between my daily stress levels and work/life balance. This finding emphasizes the importance of adopting stress management strategies to maintain a healthy balance between our professional and personal lives.\
Social Network vs. Work/Life Balance (Correlation: 0.413): I discovered a moderate positive correlation between the number of people participants interacted with during a typical day (social network) and their work/life balance scores. This implies that nurturing meaningful social connections can play a crucial role in achieving a more balanced and satisfying life.
