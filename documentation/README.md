# Wellbeing and Lifestyle Data Analysis
=======================================

## Objective
------------

This project aims to analyze the Wellbeing and Lifestyle dataset from Kaggle to gain insights into factors influencing individual wellbeing and lifestyle. The dataset contains survey responses from Authentic-Happiness.com, including attributes related to daily habits, stress levels, achievements, social interactions, and work-life balance.

## Data Description
-------------------

The dataset consists of 15,977 survey responses and includes 24 attributes such as:

- FRUITS_VEGGIES: How many fruits or vegetables do participants eat every day?

- DAILY_STRESS: Self-reported stress levels on a scale of 0 to 5.

- PLACES_VISITED: Number of new places participants visit.

## Data Analysis
----------------

In the data analysis, we performed various statistical analyses to uncover relationships between different attributes and the overall work-life balance score. We used correlation analysis to explore the strength of relationships between variables and employed data visualization techniques to present our findings.

## Results and Interpretation
-----------------------------

Our analysis revealed interesting insights:

- There is a positive correlation (r = 0.416) between the frequency of meditation and work-life balance, suggesting that regular meditation positively impacts work-life balance.

- Daily shouting has a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.303) with stress levels, indicating that increased daily shouting may lead to higher stress.

- Work-life balance shows a negative correlation (r = -0.365) with daily stress, indicating that higher stress levels may negatively affect work-life balance.

- Work-life balance has a positive correlation (r = 0.413) with the size of a person's social network, suggesting that a larger social network may contribute to a better work-life balance.

## Reproducibility
